Alfred – Sixth Sense Visual OS Agent

Created by Vishwadeep, a 17-year-old innovator from India.

Alfred is not just an AI. It's a digital human that sees, understands, and acts inside your computer — like a real user would. It has eyes (vision), hands (automation), and a brain (logic). 

Key Features
- Human-like visual perception
- Click, type, drag — just like a real person
- Works on any OS software interface without APIs
- Ideal for automation, accessibility, education, and more
